# 11. Conclusions

After considering all evidence, it seems a proven fact that community
networks make unique and important contributions to communications
freedom and the democratization of technology. Major European networks
such as Guifi and Freifunk are growing at exponential rates which
creates all kinds of stress and problems, but this is in turn just a
sign of their vibrancy. Community networks have also demonstrated that
they can make invaluable contributions in poor and thinly populated
areas. Those success stories, however, are precarious, always threatened
by the general tendencies of the neoliberal information society. The
course of development of the information society, which has been
characterized by an incomplete paradigm shift, is itself not yet a
foregone conclusion. The combination of computer networks and
computational devices has potentials for emancipation and empowerment,
but also repression, exploitation, and disenfranchisement. Within that
scenario, the relation between society and technology is a key issue.
Wireless community networks have the potential of closing the digital
divide and furthering knowledge about ICT in society, creating more
sensibility about how people can make better use of those technologies.
But this social aspect is not universally shared by all activists. Even
in the world of free networks, where free and open source software is
used, elitist attitudes sometimes prevail, which only reinforce other
social divisions of wealth, class, education, gender. Therefore, the
dispositif needs to be fundamentally revised. It needs to be spelled out
what a free network is.

In my view, and this is my real conclusion out of my engagement over
more than ten years, it is more productive to ditch the notions of Free
networks and wireless community networks and speak of the Network
Commons. The Network Commons is not a solution that already exists, but
something which yet needs to be defined. The attempts at defining the
free in free networks in the past centered on the so called Pico Peering
Agreement. But this was very minimalistic, overly determined by English
anarchic-libertarianism. What is now needed is a definition of the
Network Commons in a strong and normative sense, something that can be
read as a kind of constitution and even be turned into a legally binding
and accepted license, such as the Creative Commons license package. The
idea of the network commons stood at the beginning of this book and also
at its end. It is not a ready-made solution but an open horizon to be
explored.
